## Description
The aim of this repository is to build a solution which will help you understand how Qualys CS and WAS can be used to detect vulnerabilities in the Container Image and Web applications built from it.

## **Prerequisites:**
  1. [**An Azure Container Registry**](/examples/azurecontainerregistry.md)
  2. [**An Azure APP service with Containers**](/examples/azureappservice.md)
  3. [**A Qualys Subscription**](https://www.qualys.com/free-trial/)
 
## Usage
**Task 1:** Use the [Azure DevOps Demo Generator](https://azuredevopsdemogenerator.azurewebsites.net/) to provision the project to your Azure DevOps Org. Use the below GitHub link as source template
_https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mkhanal1/containersecurityazuredevopsdemo/master/containersecuritydemo.zip_


**Task 2:** Import this repository to Azure GIT


**Task 3:** Edit your pipeline variables in Variable Groups
The template file has these 9 variables.

  * **QUALYS_API_SERVER:** "Qualys baseurl for CS API"
  * **QUALYS_PASSWORD:** "Qualys password to call CS API"
  * **QUALYS_USERNAME:** "Qualys username to call CS API"
  * **QUALYS_WAS_PROFILEID:** "Option Profile Id"
  * **SENSOR_ACTIVATION_ID:** " Activation Id for the container sensor"
  * **SENSOR_CUSTOMER_ID:** "Qualys subscriptionâ€™s customerId"
  * **WEBAPP_PASSWORD:** "Password for the Webapp"
  * **WEBAPP_USERNAME:** "username for the Webapp"
  * **SENSOR_LOCATION:** "Path to download the sensor"
  Eg: https://{storage-account}.blob.core.windows.net/{container-name}/QualysContainerSensor.tar
